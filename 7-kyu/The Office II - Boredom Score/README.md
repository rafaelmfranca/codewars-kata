## The Office II - Boredom Score

Every now and then people in the office moves teams or departments. Depending what people are doing with their time they can become more or less boring. Time to assess the current team.

Each department has a different boredom assessment score, as follows:

trading = 6
change = 6
IS = 8
retail = 5
cleaning = 4

Depending on the cumulative score of the team, return the appropriate sentiment:

<=80: 'kill me now'
< 100 & > 80: 'i can handle this'
100 or over: 'party time!!'
