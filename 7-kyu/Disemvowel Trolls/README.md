## Disemvowel Trolls
<p>Trolls are attacking your comment section!</p>
<p>A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a function that takes a string and return a new string with all vowels removed.</p>
<p>For example, the string "This website is for losers LOL!" would become "Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!".</p>
<p>Note: for this kata <code>y</code> isn't considered a vowel.</p>
