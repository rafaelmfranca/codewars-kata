## Unshackle the Beast (uncontrolled components in ReactJS)

<div class="markdown prose max-w-none" id="description"><p>In this kata you'll learn how to use uncontrolled components in ReactJS with different kinds of chained beasts.
Your goal is to release a beast by building an uncontrolled React component with the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a component called <code>BeastForm</code>.</li>
<li>This component should have a <code>beastToRelease</code> property which is an object.</li>
<li>The initial beast will be assigned by setting the <code>value</code> property of the <code>beastToRelease</code> object.</li>
<li>The beast can be passed into the input element with the id <code>beastToRelease</code> living in a form element with the id <code>beastForm</code>.</li>
<li>The form needs to be submitted with a submit button with the id <code>submit</code> and call a function to handle the form submission.</li>
<li>This function needs to call an already existing function <code>unshackle</code> with the beast to release. </li>
<li>This function also needs to call <code>preventDefault</code> on the passed parameter.</li>
</ul>
